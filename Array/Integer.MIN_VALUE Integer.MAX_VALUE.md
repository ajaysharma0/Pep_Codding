In Java, `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE` are constants defined in the `Integer` class. They represent the minimum and maximum values that can be stored in an `int` data type, which is a 32-bit signed integer.

# - `Integer.MIN_VALUE`: This constant represents the smallest possible value that an `int` variable can hold. It is equal to `-2^31` or `-2147483648`.
# - `Integer.MAX_VALUE`: This constant represents the largest possible value that an `int` variable can hold. It is equal to `2^31 - 1` or `2147483647`.

These constants are commonly used in Java programming for various purposes, such as defining ranges for integer variables, checking for overflow conditions, and initializing variables with extreme values.

Here's an example demonstrating the use of `Integer.MIN_VALUE` and `Integer.MAX_VALUE`:

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int minValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int maxValue = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        System.out.println("Minimum value of int: " + minValue);
        System.out.println("Maximum value of int: " + maxValue);
    }
}
```

When you run this code, it will output:

```
Minimum value of int: -2147483648
Maximum value of int: 2147483647
```

These constants are particularly useful when dealing with integer arithmetic, comparisons, and boundary conditions in Java programs.
